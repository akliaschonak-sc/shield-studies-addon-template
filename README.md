[![js-standard-style](https://cdn.rawgit.com/feross/standard/master/badge.svg)](https://github.com/feross/standard)

This is the first draft of the Firefox addon that implements the client-side part of a federated learning system.

## Components

- `sql.js`: For interacting with the `moz_places` table and recalculating / changing frecency scores
- `synchronization.js`: Everything related to the federated learning protocol. Currently that means sending weight updates back using Telemetry and reading the current model from S3
- `optimization.js`: For computing model updates
- `ui-controller.js`: Observes what the user is doing in the awesome bar and retrieves the required information for history / bookmark searches (number of typed characters, selected suggestion, features of other suggestions)

`main.js` connects everything.
